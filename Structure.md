# Legion Structure

As of 2020

The Legion of Mary follows a structure based on the original organization from Dublin Ireland.

The most basic structure in the Legion is the _Praesidium_, a group of Legionaries from the same parish or organization who meet with each other on a weekly basis.

Individual Praesidia may either form part of a _Curia_ that would report to the _Comitium_ on their behalf or report to the Comitium directly.

The Comitium, in turn, must report to a higher level regional group, such as a _Senatus_.

The ultimate authority in the Legion of Mary is the _Concilium_, which is an international council located in Ireland.
