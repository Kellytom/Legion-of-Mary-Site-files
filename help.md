#### The Rest of the Story

The top menu does not contain everything. 

**Edit** shows everything in the website. We will add more pages and posts, and add tags and categories. The website can also be searched under these general categories and tags. See the search box at the bottom.

Incomplete posts and links are temporarily in **Edit**, until the website is fully operational.

The translation of the menu and the pages is incomplete. Switch to English to see all the pages in the menu.

If you want to try google translate, here is a link:

This Google translate button is imperfect and has annoying popups… It is better to use the machine translation button at the bottom of each page of each page, if it is not translated manually already.

#### Details details

We use brackets or just \[p\] to indicate paraphrased or changed text.

We also note that sometimes a link has to be tapped twice. Sorry.
