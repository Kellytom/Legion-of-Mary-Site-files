## **The Legion of Mary in Rhode Island**

Greetings,

Our mission as members of the Legion of Mary in Rhode Island is to offer everyone the chance to build a deeper relationship with Jesus through his most Blessed Mother, Mary. We meet in small groups at parishes throughout the State of Rhode Island and seek to spread the love of Jesus, often through simple acts of kindness towards those who may otherwise have been forgotten.

Such works, however, depend on the deeply Marian spirituality which we practice as members of the Legion of Mary and which we offer here to you.

One of the core pillars of this Marian spirituality is a devotion to the Rosary. As such, we have put together a set of **Rosary Meditations** to guide you through this powerful prayer. These Meditations are also meant give you a taste of what the Legion of Mary is like, as we discuss the connection between the mysteries of the Rosary, such as the Visitation and the Annunciation, and the works of the Legion, such as home visitation and a willingness to say “yes” to the things we have been called to do by the will of God.

As members of the Legion of Mary, we try to imitate Mary by living a balanced life of prayer and action. Since God came to us through Mary, we go to him through Mary. We consecrate ourselves to Mary because Jesus did.

If you would like to read more about the spirituality of the Legion, we have put together an **Overview of Legion Spirituality**, which will provide a more in-depth look at the spiritual foundation on which the Legion of Mary is built. We have also put together a **History of the Legion**, which describes the phenomenal stories of change and growth throughout our history. Finally, we would like to leave you with a message of hope, both through **Encouragement from the Saints** and through the stories of the Miraculous Medal, Our Lady of Guadalupe, and Our Lady of Fatima in **The Age of the Church**.

While it is impossible to include everything in a single website, we have provided suggestions for **Further Reading** which may help you to grow further in your own spirituality. And, if you finish reading everything we have provided so far, perhaps you may even feel called to join the Legion of Mary yourself\!

God bless,

The Legion of Mary in Rhode Island
