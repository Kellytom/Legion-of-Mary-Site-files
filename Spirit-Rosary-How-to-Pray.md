The Rosary is a Scripture-based prayer. It begins with the _Apostles’ Creed_, which summarizes the great mysteries of the Catholic faith. The _Our Father_, which introduces each mystery, is from the Gospels. The first part of the _Hail Mary_ is the angel’s words announcing Christ’s birth and Elizabeth’s greeting to Mary. St. Pius V officially added the second part of the _Hail Mary._ The Mysteries of the Rosary center on the events of Christ’s life. There are four sets of Mysteries: Joyful, Sorrowful, Glorious and––added by Saint John Paul II in 2002––the Luminous.

#### _**The prayers of the Rosary**_

The repetition in the Rosary is meant to lead one into restful and contemplative prayer related to each Mystery. The gentle repetition of the words helps us to enter into the silence of our hearts, where Christ’s spirit dwells. The Rosary can be said privately or with a group.

The **Five Joyful Mysteries** are traditionally prayed on Mondays, Saturdays, and, during the season of Advent, on Sundays:

1.  The Annunciation
2.  The Visitation
3.  The Nativity
4.  The Presentation in the Temple
5.  The Finding in the Temple

The **Five Sorrowful Mysteries** are traditionally prayed on Tuesdays, Fridays, and, during the season of Lent, on Sundays:

1.  The Agony in the Garden
2.  The Scourging at the Pillar
3.  The Crowning with Thorns
4.  The Carrying of the Cross
5.  The Crucifixion and Death

The **Five Glorious Mysteries** are traditionally prayed on Wednesdays and, outside the seasons of Advent and Lent, on Sundays:

1.  The Resurrection
2.  The Ascension
3.  The Descent of the Holy Spirit
4.  The Assumption
5.  The Coronation of Mary

The **Five Luminous Mysteries** are traditionally prayed on Thursdays:

1.  The Baptism of Christ in the Jordan
2.  The Wedding Feast at Cana
3.  Jesus’ Proclamation of the Coming of the Kingdom of God
4.  The Transfiguration
5.  The Institution of the Eucharist

#### **Praying the Rosary**

Familiarize yourself and/or your group with the **[prayers of the rosary.](https://web.archive.org/web/20211215124841/https://thelegionofmaryri.com/2019/07/19/prayers-of-the-rosary/)** See the [Importance of the Meeting](https://web.archive.org/web/20211215124841/https://thelegionofmaryri.com/2019/06/22/the-importance-of-the-meeting/) for the form used in the meetings.

1.  Make the Sign of the Cross.
2.  Holding the Crucifix, say the _Apostles’ Creed_.
3.  On the first bead, say an _Our Father._
4.  Say one _Hail Mary_ on each of the next three beads.
5.  Say the _Glory Be_
6.  For each of the five decades, announce the Mystery (perhaps followed by a brief reading from Scripture) then say the _Our Fathe_r.
7.  While fingering each of the ten beads of the decade, next say ten _Hail Mary_s while meditating on the Mystery. Then say a _Glory B_e.  
    (After finishing each decade, some say the following prayer requested by the Blessed Virgin Mary at Fatima: _O my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of hell; lead all souls to Heaven, especially those who have most need of your mercy._)
8.  After saying the five decades, say the _Hail, Holy Queen_, followed by this dialogue and prayer:

> V. Pray for us, O holy Mother of God.

> R. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

> _Let us pray: O God, whose Only Begotten Son,  
> by his life, Death, and Resurrection,  
> has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life,  
> grant, we beseech thee,  
> that while meditating on these mysteries  
> of the most holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary,  
> we may imitate what they contain  
> and obtain what they promise,  
> through the same Christ our Lord. Amen._

Prayer to St. Joseph after the Rosary

This prayer to Saint Joseph—spouse of the Virgin Mary, foster father of Jesus, and patron saint of the universal Church—was composed by Pope Leo XIII in his 1889 encyclical, Quamquam Pluries. . . . He asked that it be added to the end of the Rosary, especially during the month of October, which is dedicated to the Rosary. The prayer is enriched with a partial indulgence (Handbook of Indulgences, conc. 19), and may be said after the customary Salve Regina and concluding prayer. It may also be used to conclude other Marian devotions.

Prayer

> To you, O blessed Joseph,
> 
> do we come in our tribulation,
> 
> and having implored the help of your most holy Spouse,
> 
> we confidently invoke your patronage also.
> 
> Through that charity which bound you
> 
> to the Immaculate Virgin Mother of God
> 
> and through the paternal love
> 
> with which you embraced the Child Jesus,
> 
> we humbly beg you graciously to regard the inheritance
> 
> which Jesus Christ has purchased by his Blood,
> 
> and with your power and strength to aid us in our necessities.
> 
> O most watchful guardian of the Holy Family,
> 
> defend the chosen children of Jesus Christ;
> 
> O most loving father, ward off from us
> 
> every contagion of error and corrupting influence;
> 
> O our most mighty protector, be kind to us
> 
> and from heaven assist us in our struggle
> 
> with the power of darkness.
> 
> As once you rescued the Child Jesus from deadly peril,
> 
> so now protect God’s Holy Church
> 
> from the snares of the enemy and from all adversity;
> 
> shield, too, each one of us by your constant protection,
> 
> so that, supported by your example and your aid,
> 
> we may be able to live piously, to die in holiness,
> 
> and to obtain eternal happiness in heaven.
> 
> Amen.
