# Overview of Legion Spirituality

Legion Spirituality is simply prayer and action in union with Jesus and Mary to do the will of God.

#### Part 1: Through, with, in and for Mary to Jesus.

The prayer of the Legion is summed up in the phrase, “_I am all Yours_, _My Queen_ and _My Mother_, and _all that I have is Yours_“.. We say this at our yearly consecration. Consecration to Mary is a long phrase meaning that we want to do everything through Mary, with Mary, in Mary, and for Mary. St. Louis de Montfort says that “we give ourselves entirely and as a slave to Mary, and to Jesus through Mary.” He means, of course, the slavery of total love….

#### Part 2: The three “Cs” – Consolation, Conservation, and Conversion.

The actions of the Legion imitate Mary who Mary wants to console her children, conserve those already in the church, and bring perfect conversion to everyone in the church and outside of it. Practically, we bring consolation to those in hospitals, nursing homes, the homebound. We console those who have lost a loved one or are in sorrow.

Conservation should not be routine for us, but is essential to renew our faith. Practically, we teach Catechism or Sunday school, sponsor monthly talks about the faith, and yearly retreats. Conversion comes from prayer.

Conversion is not simply converting to the Catholic faith. Conversion begins at home. Even the greatest saint need conversion. It is said that St. Francis asked the Lord at the end of his life what to do, and Jesus said to him; “Convert!” Jesus help our poor hearts.
