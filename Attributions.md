Just as in a talk or conversation, information has been freely paraphrased and replicated in an effort to distribute as widely as possible the essentials of the Legion of Mary and devotion to Mary. Please always take the best meaning from the quotes and comments on this website. This is a rule of St. Ignatius that has served the Church well. It is easy to misinterpret or take a negative meaning from complex subjects.
