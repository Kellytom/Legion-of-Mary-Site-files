Contact Us If you have any questions regarding the Legion of Mary, would like our help in your parish, or you would like to learn how to become a member, please feel free to contact us at thelegionri@gmail.com.

If you are from another region, we still would be glad to help in any way we can. Our Days of Evangelization have spread to other areas, and we can refer you to local branches of the Legion of Mary if you like.

“Wait a minute,” you might say,” I don’t understand all this Legion stuff.” In the Legion, we normally listen to people first, and then talk with them after. This website does the opposite, so it is naturally limited and not really in the spirit of the Legion of Mary. Please bear with us, and contact us with any questions at all. We really do want to help.
