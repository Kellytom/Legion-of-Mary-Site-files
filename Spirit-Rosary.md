# The Holy Rosary and the Legion



It would be impossible to do justice to the Holy Rosary in a single webpage. Saints, Popes, and theologians, even in their most voluminous works, have not exhausted the mysteries of the Rosary, and we do not presume that our humble efforts could improve upon the great treasures they have already provided.

Rather, our aim is much narrower — we simply aim to demonstrate some of the ways that the Mysteries of the Holy Rosary relate to our work as members of the Legion of Mary.

The Holy Rosary is the lifeblood of the Legion of Mary. The Legion was born out of the Rosary, is sustained by the Rosary, and would die without constant recitation of the Rosary. The very spirit of the Legion is drawn from its meditation on the Mysteries of the Rosary.

Each Mystery of the Rosary depicts one specific way in which the will of God was shown in the lives of Jesus and his Blessed Mother, Mary. Experience has shown us that reciting the full fifteen decades of the Rosary is the surest way to stay connected to the will of God.

While we are presented with different insights into God’s will every time we meditate on the Rosary, we feel it may be particularly helpful to consider reading about some of the ways in which the Legion’s actions relate to each of the following sets of mysteries:
