About the Legion of Mary Providence Comitium
Posted on June 23, 2019byin Uncategorized
The Legion of Mary can be found in over 40 parishes and Catholic schools in Rhode Island and Southeastern Massachusetts. Each branch of the Legion of Mary is known as a “Praesidium.” A single parish can have several praesidia depending on the number of active Legionaries in the area and the demographics of the parish. Praesidia are commonly split by the language spoken by their members — both Spanish and Portugese praesidia can be found in Rhode Island and Southeastern Massachusetts.

Beyond standard Legion praesidia, several parishes in the area host junior praesidia for Junior Legionaries between the ages of seven and seventeen.

Legion praesidia do not function merely on a parish level. Praesidia located within a central area are given the option to form a group called a “Curia,” and all legionary groups in RI and Southeastern Mass are overseen (either directly or indirectly) by the Providence Comitium.

Legionaries are active in hospitals, nursing homes, schools, at the cathedral and at parishes all throughout Rhode Island and Southeastern Massachusetts. Feel free to contact us to learn where to find the Legion of Mary near you.
