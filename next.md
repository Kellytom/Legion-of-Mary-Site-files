#### Where to Go from Here

> Above all, the Legion is based on love, because each person is unique, precious and unrepeatable. Each person is a universe. In spite of our human limitations, our goals are high and our love is of Mary. Let us encourage one another. Please consider joining us.

If you have read this far, please consider taking the next step in your spiritual life. Commit to praying more and more deeply. Attend a Legion meeting. Invite a traveling statue into your home.

The decision you make is between you and the Holy Spirit… but whatever you do, make sure to take one small but concrete step.

The Legion is **not** more work and effort, but less! Because we are assigned a work every week, and repeat it, it becomes easier and easier, like tapping in a nail. It keeps us from being too busy with too many different things. Ideally, a praesidium should rotate the assignments, so that we gain experience with consolation, conservation, and conversion.

The Legion Auxiliaries are the praying arm of the Legion. Joining the Auxiliaries is an easy way to learn more about the life of the Legion. Regardless of whether you are currently a member of the Auxiliaries, however, please consider attending a Praesidium meeting near you as a guest to see how your prayers as an Auxiliary sustain the Legion meeting.

The Blessed Mother would love to visit you in your home. Several praesidia maintain traveling statues of Mary, which can be a great aid in developing a deeper prayer life.

Often, the best step to take in your spiritual life involves prayer. Please consider praying for the Legion of Mary, and keep the Legion in mind when you find yourself in need of prayers.
