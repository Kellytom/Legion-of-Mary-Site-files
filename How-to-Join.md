How to Join the Legion

Come and see
First of all, get in touch. We would be happy to see you.

Get in touch

The best way to see the Legion is to come as a guest to a weekly meeting at a local parish. We can help you find one. If you canâ€™t come to a meeting, you can still be an auxiliary member. The Legion is located in more than 35 parishes and schools around the state.
