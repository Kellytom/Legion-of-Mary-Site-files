# The Legion of Mary Auxiliaries

The secret of the Legion is its unique combination of prayer and action in Mary. The Legion’s prayer serves as the eyes of Mary and the Legion’s action serves as her hands. As such, prayer without action is ineffective, while action without prayer is blind. Those who lead a higher life of prayer provide an invaluable support to those who act.

The praying arm of the Legion, the Auxiliaries, pray the Rosary and Mary’s Magnificat that God’s will be done through the Legion. They join in the obedience of the active members by being obedient to the daily prayers of the Legion.

Because a life of prayer is a higher calling than a life of action, the prayer of the auxiliaries is, in a way, even more important to the Legion than its active works. The Legion obviously needs both, but in a paradoxical way, the value of the auxiliaries is greater than the value of the active members. One might even say that the active members actually serve the auxiliaries by acting as the hands of the Legion. Of course, while auxiliary members are called to serve as the praying arm of the Legion, active members are called to be models of constant prayer for everyone.

We can see the priority of prayer in the life of Frank Duff. Even before he started the Legion, he helped convince more than a thousand people to make promise to attend daily Mass. He also promised himself that he would pray all seven offices of the Divine Office — each a set of psalms, hymns, and readings — every day for the rest of his life. On some days, he managed to finish all of these prayers by 4:30 in the morning!

The Auxiliaries recite daily the simple prayers of the Tessera, namely: the Invocation and prayers of the Holy Spirit, 5 decades of the Rosary, the Catena (Mary’s Magnificat), and the prayers described as ‘concluding prayers’. In these prayers, we ask God for the faith of Mary:

> “Confer, O Lord, on us, who serve beneath the standard of Mary, that fullness of faith in You and trust in her, to which it is given to conquer the world….”

#### From the Legion Handbook:

> This membership is open to priests, religious and the laity. It consists of those who are unable or unwilling to assume the duties of active membership, but who associate themselves with the Legion by undertaking a service of prayer in its name.
> 
> Auxiliary membership is subdivided into two degrees:…
> 
> **THE PRIMARY DEGREE: THE AUXILIARIES**
> 
> This is one wing of the Legion’s praying army. Its service consists in the daily recitation of the prayers comprised in the Tessera, namely: the invocation and prayer of the Holy Spirit; five decades of the rosary and the invocations which follow them; the Catena; and the prayers described as “concluding prayers”. These may be divided throughout the day, as convenient.
> 
> **THE HIGHER DEGREE: THE ADJUTORIANS**
> 
> This is the other wing of the praying Legion. It comprises those who will (a) recite daily all the prayers of the Tessera and in addition (b) agree to attend Mass and receive Holy Communion daily, and to recite daily an Office approved by the Church.
> 
> This twofold auxiliary membership is to the Legion what its wings are to a bird. With these wings widely expanded by possession of many auxiliaries, and beating powerfully under the rhythmic drive of their faithful prayer, the Legion can soar into the higher air of supernatural ideal and effort. It flies swiftly wherever it wills, and even the mountains cannot stay its course. But if those wings are folded, the Legion hobbles awkwardly and slowly along the ground, brought to a stop by the slightest obstacle.
> 
> Though they are not in the fighting ranks, nevertheless they play an essential part, comparable to that of the munition workers and the supply services, without which the fighting forces are powerless.

Auxiliary members are contacted at least once a year by active members of their attached praesidium. Each year around March 25th (the Annunciation), auxiliary members are extended an invitation to the Acies, the annual ceremony of reconsecration to Mary, Queen of the Legion. Furthermore, Auxiliaries are honored with a special function around September 8th, the birth of Our Blessed Mother.

_Contact us to find the Praesidium nearest you, and they will lead you through the steps to become an auxiliary. Alternatively, if you would like to attend your local Praesidium’s weekly meeting, you are welcome to attend anytime as a guest._
